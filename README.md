Hey,

A litte Developer from Germany. Loves the earth and want to make the earth a better place.


To my Ideas:

The Python Script Generator:
Simple Checkboxes und Textboxes. Instructions should not be missing either(How to create it etc). I thing it's a great idea.
Other Discord Rich Presence Projects have one Problem: The Discord Developer Application ID. And yes: 
You can compile it your self but a bunch of people don't feel like it or don't know how tto do it.
(or a step to step toturial how to do this)

Own Discord Bot:
I wanna create a simple but powerfull Discord Bot with discord.py. Simple Stuff like !ban etc but also differnt commands like a lockdown command that locks the channel. The Bot should also have a wiki with descriptions and help for every command. How to use it, to set it up, command syntax and more.
